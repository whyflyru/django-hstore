You need **dynamic columns** in your tables. What do you do?

- Create lots of tables to handle it. Nice, now you'll need more models and lots of additional sqls. Insertion and selection will be slow as hell.
- Use a **noSQL** database just for this issue. **Good luck**.
- Create a serialized column. Nice, insertion will be fine, and reading data from a record too. But, what if you have a condition in your select that includes serialized data? Yeah, regular expressions.
